# React Resume

Welcome to my first react app! My name is Brandon Cheung. This is a interactive resume or game
that I hope showcases my technical and personal skills to any potential employers. This is the first of many self-produced app that I wish
to create, so there may be problems with this one, but I am proud of what I have created. Any feedback is welcome.
Email me at bwcheung8@gmail.com.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
